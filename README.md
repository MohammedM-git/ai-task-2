This application is a real-time color recognition tool built using Python and OpenCV. It uses a webcam feed to detect and identify objects based on their color.

In the screenshot above, the program successfully identifies and labels a red LED light on a Razer gaming mouse. The red area is outlined with a bounding box, and a label ("Red") is displayed above it. The detection is performed in HSV color space, which makes it more robust under various lighting conditions.
